# Component Usage Reporter

Scans a React / TypeScript codebase and reports how each UI component is used.

- Counts every component instance.
- Records the import path for each component.
- Calculates the average number of props per component.
- Lists components that are never imported.
- Saves all results to PostgreSQL (Prisma) or in-browser SQL.js.

Purpose & Context
Our new Component Usage Reporter is designed to analyse how React UI components are used across your codebase.

# Key Features & Workflows

1. Clone & Persist

   - Enter a Git URL and project name in CloneForm
   - Repository is cloned, built, and its usage data captured.

2. Saved Projects Management

   - SavedProjectsTable lists all analused projects with "Load" actions.
   - Quickly switch between reports to compare multiple codebases or branches.

3. Top-10 Pie Chart

   - ChartsPanel displays a pie of the ten most-imported components.
   - Immediately highlights your "core" components candiates for prioritise migration.

4. Components Per Package Bar Chart

   - Visualises how many distinct components each package contributes.
   - Reveals which libraries drive the most UI code surface.

5. Drill Down Detail Table

   - DetailTable lists each component, its average props count, import sources, usage breakdown across files.
   - Sortable by name or average props to find heavy or property rich components.

6. Unused Components

   - A collapsible list of components never imported ideal for cleanup or retirement.

# Benefits

The component Usage Reporter provides the analytical backbone for a controlled, transparent migration from legacy UI libraries to your new component system minimising risk, maximising ROI.

- Data Drive Decisions - Move from gut feel to measurable migration milestones.
- Cost Savings - Focus effort where impact is highest, avoid spending on rarely used components.
- Quality & Consistency - Standardise on a single UI library, reducing maintenance overhead.
- Transparency - Charts and tables sh owing integration progress.

   ```

2. Install dependencies
   `npm install`

3. Configure environment

```cp .env.example .env
# then edit .env and set :
DB_PROVIDER=sqljs      # or use: sqljs | prisma
